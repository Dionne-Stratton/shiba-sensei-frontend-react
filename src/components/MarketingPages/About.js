        About Rabbi Rabbit: Igniting a Passion for Hebrew Language Mastery
      </h2>
      <p>
        At Rabbi Rabbit, our journey began with a burning passion for Hebrew
        language and an unwavering desire to make learning Hebrew vocabulary an
        immersive and effective experience. Inspired by the challenges faced
        during our own study of Hebrew, we set out to create a web app that
        would revolutionize the way language learners approached vocabulary
        practice.
      </p>
      <h3>The Genesis of Rabbi Rabbit: A Personal Quest</h3>
      <p>
        As language enthusiasts and avid students of Hebrew, we discovered that
        traditional language learning methods, such as flashcards and repetitive
        drills, lacked the engagement and practicality we craved. We yearned for
        a dynamic and interactive platform that mirrored real-life language
        usage, allowing us to type in responses and encounter words in
        meaningful contexts.
      </p>
      <h3>The Vision Unveiled: A New Path to Proficiency</h3>
      <p>
        Driven by our dedication to promoting authentic language learning, we
        embarked on a mission to develop a web app that combined cutting-edge
        technology with the proven effectiveness of spaced repetition. Rabbi
        Rabbit was born - a platform that would harness the power of typing
        exercises and spaced repetition to ignite a passion for Hebrew language
        mastery like never before.
      </p>
